### Part 2: Re/Code

- Prompt
- Possible inspiration
  - Featured artists in the Class Slides
  - [PATHS](https://formfunction.xyz/@semuspace/series/paths) by @semuspace, "an
    art project inspired by the image produced by a
    [Harmonograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph), a mechanical
    device that employs a pendulum to generate images"

### Part 3: Document

- Write a blog post. Copy and paste any code from VS Code into the p5 web
  editor, so you can link to your sketches. I know this is redundant, but for
  now this is the easiest way to share.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered
  during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to
  you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
