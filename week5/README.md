## Assignment

Don't worry if you have worked with algebra and trigonometry in a long time!
Just tinker and have fun with the equations. This week is more about getting
used to implementing version control in our projgects with git on the command
line.

### Part 1: Explore and Experiment

Modify, play with the numbers (make some huge, some tiny),
change the shapes, add more than to a sketch, integrate some random
functions (`random()` and `noise()`) as suggested in Miller's video below:
"layer up sine and cosine functions". make a grid? - what's the last part of
encode/decode, make multiples?

- Highly recommend this video! [Recreating Vintage Computer Art with
  Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaarVR1AOvs), inspired by John
  Whitney’s work (linked below), is an excellent introduction to creative coding
  with parametric equations with sine and cosine functions. (What's the
  [`return`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return)
  keyword?)
- The above example translates well to p5. In fact, it inspired this
  [Parametric Equations](https://p5js.org/examples/math-parametric-equations.html) example in the p5 Reference.

### Part 2: Re/Code

- Code your own screensaver! (Hmmm...are we coming full circle to connect
  back to Week 1's loading animations? )
- Possible inspiration
  - Featured artists in the Class Slides
  - Classic Windows screensavers:

### Part 3: Document

- Write a blog post. Copy and paste any code from VS Code into the p5 web
  editor, so you can link to your sketches. I know this is redundant, but for
  now this is the easiest way to share.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered
  during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to
  you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
