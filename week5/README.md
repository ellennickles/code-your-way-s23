## Assignment

Don't worry if you have worked with algebra and trigonometry in a long time!
Just tinker and have fun with the equations in the code examples. This week is
more about getting used to implementing version control in our projects with Git
using a command line interface.

### Part 1: Explore and Experiment

Modify each sketch to make it your own: play with the numbers (make some huge,
some tiny), change the shapes, make multiples of an animation, integrate some
random functions (`random()` and `noise()`), "layer up sine and cosine
functions" as suggested in Miller's video (linked below), make a grid, make it
interactive, combine it with a previous sketch.

  Whitney’s work (linked below), is an excellent introduction to creative coding
  with parametric equations with sine and cosine functions. (What's the

### Part 2: Re/Code

- Code your own screensaver! (Hmmm... are we coming full circle to Week 1's
  preloaders?) Further extend one of the examples above or combine some?

### Part 3: Document

- Write a blog post. Copy and paste any code from VS Code into the p5 web
  editor, so you can link to your sketches. I know this is redundant, but for
  now this is the easiest way to share.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered
  during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to
  you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
