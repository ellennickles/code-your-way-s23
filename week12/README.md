# Week 12 • Individual Meetings

## Assignment

- You have your plan for the next two (2) weeks. You know what to do. If
  figuring out the _how_, you realize that you need to pivot, that’s okay.
- Next week’s class (Week 13) will be a flexible mixture of in-class work time
  and user testing. Choose one or the other, or both.
- For whatever you decide to do, please submit a project update before class,
  summing up your timeline progress to date and what you want to accomplish
  during next week’s class time, as well as during the final week of the
  semester.
- If you are user testing, what are you testing and why? If you plan to use the
  time to work on your project, what’s the task / question you’re addressing?
