## Syllabus

### Course Description
This course provides students an opportunity to sharpen their coding skills in several ways: by reviewing fundamental programming concepts, acquiring techniques to systematically develop code-driven projects, and then implementing those to develop an independent project with the structure and support of a classroom learning community.

The first part of the semester consists of weekly exercises to practice strategies for learning new algorithms, writing pseudocode, pair programming, debugging, refactoring, version control, and more. Screen-based code examples for the activities and assignments draw inspiration from the history of creative coding. The second part of the semester shifts to a project development studio format for students to apply these strategies to a self-directed project. This could be an existing idea or one devised during the course.

Ultimately this course aims to empower students to reflect on their process and teach themselves how to program with greater efficiency and independence. It is a direct follow-up to Introduction to Computational Media (ICM) or for anyone interested in advancing their coding practice.

Examples and exercises will be provided in JavaScript using the p5.js library. However, students are welcome to consult the instructor about working with another programming library, framework, or language with which they have interest or prior experience. Prerequisite: ICM or equivalent experience

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, we will be able to:
- identity gaps in our understanding about coding concepts for further review and practice;
- explain techniques to debug and refactor our programs;
- apply these techniques to troubleshoot and optimize existing or new code;
- track and store revisions to our programs using a dedicated version control system;
- compare approaches for designing and developing code-based projects;
- outline a plan to independently create such a project;
- integrate any relevant technical concepts and strategies necessary to complete it.

### Community Guidelines
In keeping with the [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index), this course is committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for everyone in our community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content.

#### Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces
We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use requested pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however, our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor.

### Participation and Attendance
#### Participation
This class is highly participatory, and there are many ways to demonstrate your engagement with the course material and with your peers:
contribute to class discussions;
ask and answer questions, especially to and from your peers;
share your assignments and progress with the class;
participate in group exercises with curiosity and enthusiasm;
help your peers by sharing your knowledge and experience.

#### Absences
Attendance is mandatory. If you think you will be absent, please contact me as soon as possible. Two unexcused absences are cause for failing the course. 

#### Lateness
An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 of an unexcused absence.

### Overview of Assignments
We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required, and you should be prepared to share and talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in our class will create and maintain a blog (or something similar) for their assignments. The course culminates with a final independent project. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the course that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world.

### Evaluation
Final course evaluation will be based on participation and attendance, and the completion of all assignments, including the final independent project, according to this breakdown:

- 30% Participation and attendance
- 50% Weekly assignments
- 20% Independent project

This class uses a [Pass/Fail](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/pass-fail/) grading system. A Pass is equivalent to an A or a B grade, and anything less is considered a Fail.

### Statements
#### Academic Integrity / Statement of Principle
Excerpt from the NYU Tisch School of the Arts [Policies and Procedures Handbook](https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks), please read the full text for additional information:

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s original work as if it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: a sequence of words quoted without quotation marks, a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work, ideas, sound recordings, computer data, or images composed or created by someone else.

Students are expected to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional artists, scholars, and writers do. Giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity; plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud.

#### Use of Free and Open Source Materials Including Code
You must cite the source of any material/code you use with the exception of examples specifically provided by the instructor or demonstrated for the course. Please note the following additional expectations and guidelines:
- **Check the license**. When using others' code, pay attention to the license under which it has been released, and be certain to fulfill the terms and requirements of those licenses. Descriptions of common licenses, and their requirements, can be found at [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/). Some licenses may require permission. If you are confused or aren’t sure how to credit code, ask one of the course instructors and make your best good faith effort. Not properly citing code sources is grounds for receiving a 0 on an assignment.
- **Use libraries**. The use of general, repurposable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.
- **Be careful**. It sometimes happens that an artist places the entire source code for their sketch or artwork online, as a resource from which others can learn. Assignments professors give in new media arts courses are often similar; you may also discover the work of a student in some other class or school, who has posted code for a project which responds to a similar assignment. You should probably avoid this code. At the very least, you should be careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a poetic experience. Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others' code, is to make it your own. It should be clear that downloading an artwork from someone's p5 account or GitHub and simply changing the colors would be disgracefully lazy. And doing so without proper citation would be outright plagiarism.

Free counseling sessions are provided.

#### Title IX
Tisch School of the Arts is dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender.  Detailed information regarding these policies and the resources that are available to students through the Title IX office can be found by using the following link: [Title IX at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html).

#### Use of Electronic Devices
Laptops and tablets are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational use of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. This includes recreational use of phones, music players, video game systems. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your laptop should always be closed whenever a fellow student is presenting.
