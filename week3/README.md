## Assignment

### Part 1: Practice

Assemble and modify:

- [Review loops](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/sketches/Qo7DHHcFk)
  (directions in sketch)

Use the [Encode process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s23/blob/main/encode.md) to reverse engineer these sketches:

- [Encode 1](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/iu3hqCt1e)
- [Encode 2](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/sTAx_W5n_)

Use the [Decode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s23/blob/main/decode.md)
to practice reading and analyzing code before running it to predict the outcome:

- [Decode 1](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s23/blob/main/week3/decode1.js)
- [Decode 2](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s23/blob/main/week3/decode2.js)

### Part 2: Re/Code

- Can you apply these techniques to scale, color, and play with geometric/organic forms? What can you animate, make interactive, or both? Can you make an interactive sketch that maps order to chaos based on the mouse position, e.g. “order” on the left and “chaos” on the right? Can you extend an example or self-designed composition from previous weeks with this week’s theme? (Source: *Code as a Creative Medium*)

### Part 3: Document

- Write a blog post. Link to your sketches from Part 2 and Part 3.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot? What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?

### Part 4: Prepare for next week's class

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
