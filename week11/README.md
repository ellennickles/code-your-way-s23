# Week 11 â€¢ Guest Feedback

## Assignment

### Part 1: Sign up for an Individual Meeting (Zoom)

- We will not meet as a class next Monday, April 24.
- Instead plan to meet with Ellen in an individual meeting on
  [Zoom](https://nyu.zoom.us/my/ellennickles) to share your progress and
  two-week timeline for the remaining weeks of the semester.
- (There might not be time to troubleshoot technical questions, but we can
  certainly set up a followup time to do that.)
- [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZB010-BZZCvTPnROOD60sdyVm3Kd8EZiMb9rWRcsD8A/edit).

### Part 2: Keep Going and Two-week Timeline

- Keep working on your project.
- Summarize your progress so far and create a two-week timeline that
  represents what you can realistically accomplish in the next two weeks before
  before final project presentations.
- What are you doing and what have you done so far? What do you need to figure out? What steps do you need to take? What resources and support do you need? How much time? In what aspect(s) would you like feedback? (What are you unsure of conceptually, creatively, or technically?) Etc.
- [Submit your progress and timeline here](https://forms.gle/5AgRQUsAeUj8mVNTA).
