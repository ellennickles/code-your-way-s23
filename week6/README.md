## Assignment

- Due in two weeks
- The ideas this week are to practice refactoring code and also storing code on
  GitHub.

### Part 1: Refactor + Git

- Create a local directory with a p5 project, initialize it at as a [Git
  repository](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s23/blob/main/week5/git.md),
  and refactor a previous sketch so that the output is the same but
  the the code has been restructured.
- You can refactor a sketch from this course or another one. If your sketch is
  in the p5 web editor, copy and paste the code into your local p5 project on
  your computer.
- Challenge yourself to refactor a prior sketch that you really enjoyed but
  feels messy because you ran out or time, have a different understanding
  of to implement programming concepts, and/or you have inklings that the code
  could be written in more efficient ways.
- As you refactor, commit notable changes or milestones:
  - Look for repeating elements for which you can convert into a loop, a
    function, or a class to make objects.
  - Is there any unused code to remove?
  - Any variables or functions to rename so that someone else reading your code
    can follow along without necessarily needed to read the comments?
  - But comments are okay too! Especially to reinforce your own understanding
    of programming concepts and how your sketch works.
  - If there’s a lot of code, can you organize separate into different
    files?(See [Coding Train video on how organize your code into multiple
    JavaScript files](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/6-objects/4-editor-js-files).)
  
### Part 2: Document + GitHub

- Push your repository to your GitHub account. Write a blog post that includes
  the original code and a link to the refactored code in GitHub.
- Describe and reflect on the changes you made and why you made them. How did it
  go with Git and GitHub this week? For all of it, where did you get stuck, and
  what steps did you take troubleshoot? Anything that you would like to explore
  and practice more?

### Part 3: Prepare for next class

- After the break, we’ll start transitioning to the second part of the course in
  which you’ll work on an independent project (which could also be a series of
  smaller projects) of your choice and practice programming concepts and
  strategies from the first half of semester even more!
- Start pondering / brainstorming about what you might like to do and be
  prepared to informally share some nascent ideas (it’s totally okay if your
  change them later).
- We’ll talk more about the independent projects next time. Have a wonderful
  spring break!
