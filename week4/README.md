## Assignment

- Due in two weeks
- Practice as much as you can in **Visual Studio Code**

### Part 1: Practice

Some of these are tricky. Do the best you can to get a sense of the logical and
visual pattern(s). Your choice:

(input to output)

### Part 2: Re/Code

- Part of this week's assignment is getting accustomed to working in Visual
  Studio Code.
- The other part is continuing to practice programming. Extending our work with
  loops and patterns (last week of grids?!), progression is the theme this week:
  how can you represent continuous change(s) within the composition color,
  position, size, speed etc.) and/or over time? Is the quality of change gradual
  or uneven? For example, can you make an interactive sketch that maps order to chaos based
  on the mouse position, e.g. “order” on the left and “chaos” on the right
  (prompt from _Code as a Creative Medium_)? Can you extend an example or
  self-designed sketch from previous weeks with this week’s theme. If you worked
  with gradients in the past, what are other ways to demonstrate a shift? Just some
  ideas to get started, in addition to those in the Class Slides.

### Part 3: Document

- Write a blog post. Copy and paste any code from VS Code into the p5 web
  editor, so you can link to your sketches. I know this is redundant, but for
  now this is the easiest way to share.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered
  during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to
  you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
