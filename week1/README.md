## Assignment

### Part 1: Set up
Make sure you have a blog or some place to document your work and reflect on your process this semester. 

### Part 1: Encode
Use this the Encode process to reverse engineer these sketches:
- [Encode 1](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/tUqBW4i_M) (class example, complete only if you still have questions)
- [Encode 2](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/JqMTxN0qK) 
- [Encode 3](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/hQarEjHRj)
- [Encode 4](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/ORPaX2LvZ)
- [Encode 5](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/7uPrEtc4z)

### Part 3: Re/Code
- Create a loading icon (aka preloader or throbber) animation with code. Find and recode an existing one (different from the ones above) or design your own. Where do you often see these types of icons? Think of all the loading and waiting animations you encounter in your digital interactions, e.g. streaming video, connecting to devices, syncing accounts, payment transactions, etc. Are the icons related to waiting (or wasting) time? What does a loading icon communicate or hide? What aspect of experiencing time on a machine do you want to explore or express? (Source: [Aesthetic Programming](https://aesthetic-programming.net/))
- Practice writing pseudocode to start the process. Write an outline to guide you through the steps. It’s okay if you veer away from the original plan, the idea is to practice this approach.

### Part 4: Document
- Write a blog post. Link to your commented sketches from all the exercises.
- Reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you? Where did you get stuck and what steps did you take to troubleshoot? What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
